Overview
The Portfolio Management Application is a comprehensive web-based tool for managing stock portfolios, analyzing performance, assessing risks, optimizing allocations, and simulating scenarios. Built with Streamlit for the user interface and yfinance for financial data retrieval, it supports daily data intervals and historical analysis from 2015 onward. The application incorporates Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to compute metrics such as Sharpe ratio, beta, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).
This project is designed for educational and personal use. It assumes a default starting balance of $100,000 USD and fetches data from Yahoo Finance. Note that this is not financial advice; consult a professional for investment decisions.
